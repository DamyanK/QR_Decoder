# QR_Decoder

# About the project
This is the first working version of a QR Code Decoder for steganography. It is entirelly objected to unmask a code,
 stored in a graphical file (.png, .jpg, etc.), read its original message and data stored in 'Error bits'.

# More information incomming

It is required for the .png image not to contain border around the QR code. If possible to be removed,
otherwise the script should be tampered manually.
Recommended size (current version 1): 210x210
This [script](get_size.sh) is for getting the .png file pixel size on the X axis.
